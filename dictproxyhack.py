"""Exposes the immutable `dictproxy` type to all (?) versions of Python.
Should work in 2.3+, 3.0+.  Actually tried on 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and PyPy 2.1.

Usage is easy:

    from dictproxyhack import dictproxy
    myproxy = dictproxy(dict(foo="bar"))
    print(myproxy['foo'])
    myproxy['baz'] = "quux"  # TypeError

dictproxy is GvR's answer to the desire for a "frozendict" type; see the
PEP at http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0416/#rejection-notice.  It's the
type of immutable `__dict__` attributes, and it exposes a read-only view of an
existing dict.  Changes to the original dict are visible through the proxy, but
the proxy itself cannot be changed in any way.

dictproxy has been publicly exposed in Python 3.3 as `types.MappingProxyType`.
It already exists in earlier versions of Python, back to the dark days of 2.2,
but doesn't expose a constructor to Python-land.  This module hacks one in.
Enjoy.
